# BUNN-Escrow Manager

This Escrow manager helps automates the escrow process using the power of smart contracts powered by Blockchain technology

# What is an escrow?

An escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party, known as an escrow agent, holds and regulates payment of funds or assets on behalf of two parties involved in a transaction. The funds or assets are held in the escrow account until specific conditions are met or contractual obligations are fulfilled. This intermediary role provides a level of security and trust for both parties, ensuring that neither party is at risk of non-compliance or default.
This system is still reliant on trust thus making it risky.
The need for a trustless and safe system arises. This is what our project aims to solve.
